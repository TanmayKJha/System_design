# System_design
Welcome to my System Design repository! ðŸš€ Here, you'll find comprehensive notes and insights on High-Level Design (HLD) concepts that Iâ€™ve learned and curated. This repository will serve as a growing collection of system design knowledge, starting with HLD and, in the future, expanding to include Low-Level Design (LLD) notes and resources.

Current Content
Detailed HLD notes covering basic to intermediate concepts.
Examples and explanations to help you understand the fundamentals of designing scalable systems.
Acknowledgment

Stay tuned as this repository evolves with more content and practical design insights! âœ¨
